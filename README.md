### Hi there 👋

My name is Denis,  

I have BSc degree in Computing Technologies from Roehampton University in London . 	:trophy:

I specialize in Java backend development, creating scalable and efficient server-side applications. Alongside my backend expertise, I'm currently exploring React for front-end development and expanding my knowledge of AWS cloud services. I also bring experience in Jira Administration, helping teams streamline their development processes.

Building robust, scalable back-end systems using Java and frameworks like Spring Boot
Creating full-stack applications with Java backends and React frontends
Utilizing AWS services to develop and deploy cloud-native solutions
Managing workflows and customizing projects through Jira Administration


🚀 What drives me:
Mastering Java and back-end architecture
Learning and applying React to enhance front-end development skills
Integrating AWS services like EC2, S3, and Lambda into scalable applications
Optimizing project management workflows through Jira


🌱 Currently exploring:
React for building modern, dynamic UIs
Cloud infrastructure with AWS
Effective Jira Administration for better team productivity

🚀 What drives me:
Learning new technologies and best practices
Solving complex challenges with simple, effective solutions
Sharing knowledge through documentation, blog posts, and collaboration with the dev community

🔧 Tools & Technologies:
Back-end: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs
Databases: MySQL
Front-end: React (Learning), JavaScript (Learning), HTML, CSS
Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)
